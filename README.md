# Magic-Numerical-Bases-Conversion
A card game to practice the conversion from the binary numeric base to the decimal numeric base and vice-versa.
It's like Magic the Gathering.
Each player needs a complete copy of the deck

# Turn structure
* Untap all cards
* Draw a card
* Play additional cards, respecting cost rules
** One BINARY ZERO card each turn
** Tapping BINARY ZERO cards to pay other cards cost
* Defend the attack combining untapped BINARY ZEROs and BINARY ONEs forming a number less or equal the attacking DECIMAL INTEGERS
* Calculate the received damage (difference betweet the DECIMAL INTEGER and the number created with the combination of BINARY ZEROs and BINARY ONEs)
* Pass the turn to other player
